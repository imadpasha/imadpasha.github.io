						Cassiopeia A is a Supernova Remnant (SNR) in the Milky Way galaxy, in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is approximately 11 thousand lightyears away, and is between 320 and 350 years old. Cas A is particularly notable for its unique structure. In particular, two jetlike structures can be seen, a primary jet in the upper left quadrant, and a weaker, more diffuse counterpart in the lower right. These "jets" have puzzled astronomers and generated controversy for years, as different models predict how the structures may have been created. In addition to these jets, Chandra images of the SNR indicate a highly asymmetrical distribution of elements within the SNR, prompting further questions about the explosion mechanism and initial conditions that were present 350 years ago when the explosion occurred.</more></p>
<p><more>
Some theories posit that the explosion mechanism for Cas A was an internal core instablity which resulted in a bipoler jet-like explosion (as described by Khokhlov et. al, 1999). This theory would sugget that the jets we see today are the renmants of that jet-driven explosion. However, we do not believe that the jets seen today are strong evidence for a jet-driven supernova. Several features of Cas A bring into question whether a bipolar instability was a necessary explosion mechanism. First, Khokhlov indicates that these jets would be rich in iron (due to the origin of the jets being in the core of the progenitor). Iron, however, is notably missing from the jets in Cas A. Additionally, jet-driven SN theory predicts that the "kick-direction," the axis along which the neutron star produced by the SN is ejected, should be inline with the jet axes. In Cas A we find measurements indicating the neutron star was kicked on an axis perpendicular to the jets.</more></p>
<p><more>
There is perhaps a more simple explanation. Blondin et. al (1996) demonstrated via two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that given a spherically symmetric SN explosion, the presence of asymmetrical circumstellar medium (CSM), usually due to the slow asymmetric wind of the progenitor, can generate jet like extrusions in the SNR ejecta. In Hwang et. al. (2004), this possible explanation is mentioned but discounted on the basis of 1-D shocked ejecta trajectory calculations carried out by Truelove and Mckee (1999). It is now apparent, however, that one-dimensional simulations cannot properly model a system like Cas A, and in fact, three-dimensions are required to determine the validity or invalidity of the hypothesis that the CSM alone could be responsible for the structures visible today.</more></p>
<p><more>
Over the summer of 2014, I ran a simulation of Cas A on the Stampede Supercomputer, part of TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center). The simulation was a 512x320x1150 zone three dimensional hydrodynamic simulation run using the VH-1 code. We constructed an initial ejecta profile with models of progenitor element distributions (courtesy of Dr. Carla Frohlich), which followed a typical power law profile. Around it we introduced a slightly asymmetric CSM, with a slight overdensity at the equator compared to the polls. After running the simulation out to approximately 350 years, we determined that our model closely fit Cas A, with average SN ejecta velocities of around 30,000 km/s and final shock velocites ~ 3000 km/s (the current speed of Cas A's shock).</more></p>
<p><more>
Despite the gradual and shallow function we implemented for the density variation, we were able to produce remarkably pronounced jets in the polar regions of the expanding ejecta (see below). These results indicate that a jet-driven explosion is not a prerequisite for SNR with jet-like features, even strongly pronounced ones. Upon examination of the complex structure within the Cas A SNR, it is clear that the SN that produced it was not symmetric by any means. It was a chaotic and turbulent event. However, our findings seem to indicate that the explosion-mechanism could still have been generally spherically symmetric, and/or not jet-driven.						</more></p>
